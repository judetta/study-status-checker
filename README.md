# Study status checker

Small app to check the status of studies using Trello API.

This app was originally built as a course work for basics of programming course in Fall 2020. 
After that I have only slightly adjusted the cgi and added some styling for it to fit my website. 
So there is both a console app and a web app with UI. The app is using Trello API to fetch the 
data from my Trello board for studies. So, not only the first Python app but also the first time 
using APIs.

The code could be a lot better, and maybe at some point I'll polish it further, but for my first 
Python app I think this is pretty cool - and I'm proud of it :)
